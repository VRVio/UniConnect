## About the Project

The idea for UniConnect came when my classmate and I missed our chance to join a campus club simply because we didn't have access to the right WhatsApp group where the information was shared. UniConnect was created to prevent this from happening to other students by centralizing campus announcements, event details, and club applications in one easy-to-use web platform for our college.

With UniConnect, students are empowered to:
- Stay up-to-date with university events
- Connect with clubs and societies
- Never miss an important announcement or application deadline
